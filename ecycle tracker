# Recycle Tracker

## Project Description

Recycle Tracker is a blockchain-based smart contract system designed to incentivize and track recycling activities. The platform allows users to record their recycling activities, earn tokens as rewards, and redeem those tokens for various benefits. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures transparency, immutability, and trust in recycling data while promoting environmental sustainability.

The smart contract manages recycling records, verifies activities through authorized personnel, and maintains a token-based reward system that encourages continued participation in recycling programs.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a transparent, decentralized ecosystem that motivates individuals and communities to actively participate in recycling activities. By combining blockchain technology with environmental sustainability, we aim to:

- **Foster Environmental Responsibility**: Encourage widespread adoption of recycling practices through tangible rewards
- **Build Trust and Transparency**: Utilize blockchain's immutable ledger to create verifiable recycling records
- **Create Economic Incentives**: Establish a token-based economy that makes recycling financially rewarding
- **Scale Global Impact**: Provide a framework that can be adopted worldwide to track and incentivize recycling efforts
- **Bridge Technology and Sustainability**: Demonstrate how blockchain can solve real-world environmental challenges

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Solidity ^0.8.19
- Ethereum development environment (Hardhat, Truffle, or Remix)
- Web3 wallet (MetaMask recommended)

### Deployment
1. Compile the smart contract using your preferred development environment
2. Deploy to your chosen Ethereum network (testnet recommended for testing)
3. Interact with the contract using Web3 libraries or DApp interfaces

### Usage Examples
```solidity
// Record recycling activity
recycleTracker.recordRecycling("plastic", 500); // 500 grams of plastic

// Verify a record (owner only)
recycleTracker.verifyRecord(1);

// Redeem tokens
recycleTracker.redeemTokens(100);

// Check user statistics
recycleTracker.getUserStats(userAddress);
